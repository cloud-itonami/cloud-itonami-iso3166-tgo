  "Market-Entry Compliance Governor -- the independent compliance layer
  that earns the MarketEntry-LLM the right to commit. The LLM has no
  notion of Togolese procurement law, whether a claimed engagement fee
  actually equals base + months x rate, whether a market the engagement
  itself declares reserved for jeunes/femmes entrepreneurs actually ran
  through Décret n°2018-028/PR Art. 2's permitted simplified procedures,
  whether a NIF (Numéro d'Identification Fiscale) has been verified for
  a filing that requires it, or when a draft stops being a draft and
  becomes a real-world OSMAPT (osmapt.arcop.tg) portal submission, so
  this MUST be a separate system able to *reject* a proposal and fall
  back to HOLD.

  `:itonami.blueprint/governor` is `:market-entry-compliance-governor`
  (shared family keyword on blueprints).

  This blueprint's own text (docs/business-model.md Trust Controls:
  'any actual portal registration or filing submission requires
  Market-Entry Compliance Governor clearance and always escalates to
  human sign-off'; 'a false or fabricated regulatory-requirement claim
  is a HARD hold') names exactly the checks below.

  Six checks, in priority order, ALL HARD violations: a human
  approver CANNOT override them. The confidence/actuation gate is
  SOFT: it asks a human to look (low confidence / actuation), and the
  human may approve -- but see `marketentry.phase`: for `:stake
  :actuation/draft-filing`/`:actuation/submit-filing` NO phase ever
  allows auto-commit either. Two independent layers agree that
  actuation is always a human call.

    1. Spec-basis                  -- did the jurisdiction proposal cite
                                       an OFFICIAL source
                                       (`marketentry.facts`), or invent
                                       one?
    2. Evidence incomplete         -- for `:filing/draft`/
                                       `:filing/submit`, has the
                                       jurisdiction actually been
                                       assessed with a full evidence
                                       checklist on file?
    3. Youth/women reserved-market
       procedure mismatch          -- for `:filing/submit`, when the
                                       engagement itself declares
                                       `:reserved-for-youth-women? true`,
                                       INDEPENDENTLY check that its own
                                       declared `:procedure-type` is one
                                       of Décret n°2018-028/PR Art. 2's

                                       `marketentry.registry`.
    4. Engagement fee mismatch     -- for `:filing/submit`,
                                       INDEPENDENTLY recompute whether
                                       the engagement's own `:claimed-

                                       monthly-rate x monitoring-

    5. NIF unverified               -- for `:filing/submit`, when the
                                       engagement declares
                                       `:requires-nif? true`,
